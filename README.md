# Jumbled-words-game and also my first work with tkinter
The app provide random jumbled sentences to the users.
The users guesses the actual word from the given jumbled words and can write it and press submit.
A message-box will pop up telling whether the answer given by the user is right or wrong.
And likewise score for the user will be shown on the app.
The user is given chance to move out of the game anytime he wants.
The user will also get an opportunity to press on the reset button if he thinks that he doesn't know the answer of the jumbled word given and can move to the next word.

Thank you!!
